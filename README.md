# First Three.js Project
This repository contains my first project using Three.js, a 3D graphics library for the web. The goal of this project was to explore the basics of 3D rendering and interactivity on the web, using WebGL and Three.js.

## Features:
- 3D Cube: The core of this project is a rotating 3D cube rendered with Three.js.
- Camera Control: Added camera controls using OrbitControls to allow for interactive rotation, zoom, and panning of the scene.
- Cursor Pointer: Implemented raycasting to change the cursor to a pointer - when hovering over the 3D object.
- Technologies Used:
- Three.js: A JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics in the browser.
- WebGL: The low-level API for rendering 3D graphics.
- OrbitControls: A Three.js utility for enabling interactive controls of the camera.

## Future Improvements:
- Add lighting and shadows for better visual effects.
- Make the cube clickable or interactive.
- Implement different geometries and materials for more variety.
